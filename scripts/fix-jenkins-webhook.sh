echo "ðŸ”§ Jenkins Build Trigger Fix"
echo "==========================="

echo "The issue: Jenkins thinks there are 'No changes' because the first build failed"
echo "Solution: We need to either manually trigger a build or reset the SCM state"
echo ""

echo "Option 1: Manual Web Trigger (Recommended)"
echo "1. Go to: http://54.81.93.16:8080/job/vle7-blue-green-pipeline/"
echo "2. Click 'Build with Parameters'"
echo "3. Select DEPLOYMENT_COLOR: blue (or green)"
echo "4. Keep SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD: false" 
echo "5. Click 'Build'"
echo ""

echo "Option 2: Reset SCM Polling"
echo "1. Go to: http://54.81.93.16:8080/job/vle7-blue-green-pipeline/configure"
echo "2. Scroll to 'Build Triggers'"
echo "3. Uncheck 'GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling'"
echo "4. Save"
echo "5. Go back to configure"
echo "6. Re-check 'GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling'"
echo "7. Save"
echo ""

echo "Option 3: Force SCM Update (via Jenkins Script Console)"
echo "1. Go to: http://54.81.93.16:8080/script"
echo "2. Run this Groovy script:"
echo ""

// Reset SCM polling for vle7-blue-green-pipeline
def job = Jenkins.instance.getItem('vle7-blue-green-pipeline')
